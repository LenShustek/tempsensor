This project consists of four small battery-powered remote wirelesss temperature sensors, and a single wall-powered receiver for them that replaces the temperature-monitoring thermistors inside wall-mounted thermostats.

My motivation: we have a four-zone Mitsubishi/Honeywell MNET-based HVAC system that was incorrectly designed without temperature monitoring in the zones. We want to avoid breaking walls and ceilings to wire compatible themostats. The Honeywell C7189 wireless indoor remote temperature sensor is not compatible, and we don't like the complicated Mitsubishi MRCH1 wireless remote controller because it's big, ugly, and conflicts with the automation system (Control4) that is supposed to be in control of all the HVAC zones.

This project reinstates the four centrally located wired wall-mounted PAR-21MAA thermostats that were part of the original design, but replaces their temperature-sensing thermistors with resistances generated by "digital potentiometers" controlled by an Arduino microprocessor. The wireless remote temperature sensors send periodic wireless packets to the central receiver. The indoor range is several hundred feet.

The first version of the system -- which used an LCD display, the Seeed HC-12 433 Mhz transceiver, and a Teensy LC processor -- was installed in December 2015 and worked well for years. The only annoying issue was that with the best low-power code I could muster, the lifetime of the three AAA batteries in each temperature sensor was only 2-3 months.

That prompted me to make a second version of the temperature sensor that uses an e-Paper display, a HopeRF LoRa 868/915 Mhz transceiver, and a bare ATMega328 processor. The average power utilization is now below 100 uA, which should result in battery life of well over a year.

The code and design of the first version is still accessible by looking at older versions of the files in this repository.
