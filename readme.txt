This project consists of four small battery-powered remote wirelesss temperature sensors, and a single wall-powered receiver for them that replaces the temperature-monitoring thermistors inside wall-mounted thermostats.

My motivation: we have a four-zone Mitsubishi/Honeywell MNET-based HVAC system that was incorrectly designed without temperature monitoring in the zones. We want to avoid breaking walls and ceilings to wire compatible themostats. The Honeywell C7189 wireless indoor remote temperature sensor is not compatible, and we don't like the complicated Mitsubishi MRCH1 wireless remote controller because it's big, ugly, and conflicts with the automation system (Control4) that is supposed to be in control of all the HVAC zones.

This project reinstates the four centrally located wired wall-mounted PAR-21MAA thermostats that were part of the original design, but replaces their temperature-sensing thermistors with resistances generated by "digital potentiometers" controlled by an Arduino microprocessor. The wireless remote temperature sensors send periodic packets over the unlicensed 433 Mhz UHF band to the central receiver. The indoor range is several hundred feet.

The system is installed and seems to be working well. The last issue is that the RF transmitter in the temperature sensors, the HC-12 from Seeed Studios, is not going into lower-power hibernation mode, so the battery lifetime is not the year or more that I wanted. I'm working with the applications engineer from Seeed on a possible fix, but if I can't get hibernation to work I'll add something to switch off the power to it externally, perhaps using the tiny TI TPS27081A "high-side load switch".
