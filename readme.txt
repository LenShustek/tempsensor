This project consists of four small battery-powered remote wireless temperature sensors, and a single wall-powered receiver for them that replaces the temperature-monitoring thermistors inside wall-mounted thermostats.

My motivation: we have a four-zone Mitsubishi/Honeywell MNET-based HVAC system that was incorrectly designed without temperature monitoring in the zones. We want to avoid breaking walls and ceilings to wire compatible themostats. The Honeywell C7189 wireless indoor remote temperature sensor is not compatible, and we don't like the complicated Mitsubishi MRCH1 wireless remote controller because it's big, ugly, and conflicts with the automation system (Control4) that is supposed to be in control of all the HVAC zones.

This project reinstates the four centrally located wired wall-mounted PAR-21MAA thermostats that were part of the original design, but replaces their temperature-sensing thermistors with resistances generated by "digital potentiometers" controlled by an Arduino-like microprocessor. The wireless remote temperature sensors send periodic wireless packets to the central receiver. The indoor range is several hundred feet.

The first version of the system -- which used an LCD display, the Seeed HC-12 433 Mhz transceiver, and a Teensy LC processor -- was installed in December 2015 and worked well for years. The only annoying issue was that with the best low-power code I could muster, the lifetime of the three AAA batteries in each temperature sensor was only 2-3 months.

That prompted me to make a second version of the temperature sensor that uses an e-Paper display, a HopeRF LoRa 868/915 Mhz transceiver, and a bare ATMega328 processor. The average power utilization is now below 100 uA, which resulted in battery life of well over a year.

Unfortunately Waveshare decided to redesign their e-paper module to be 5V compatible, and the resulting quiescent power drain from the voltage regulator and level shifters destroys the "zero current when sleeping" feature that made me choose e-paper displays in the first place. In addition, some of their older modules are defective and use 100 mA when updating the display instead of the specified 12 mA maximum, which puts battery life back to months, not years. 

That prompted me to make a third version that uses just the raw e-paper display, not the module. It was also an opportunity to exercise my newly-learned skills of designing and fabricating boards with only surface-mount components. The average power utilization is now about 60 uA, so the batteries last almost two years.
