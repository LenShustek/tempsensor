This project is to build small battery-powered remote wirelesss temperature sensors, and a single wall-powered receiver that replaces the temperature-monitoring thermistors inside wall-mounted thermostats.

My motivation: we have a four-zone Mitsubishi/Honeywell MNET-based HVAC system that was incorrectly designed without temperature monitoring in the zones. We want to avoid breaking walls and ceilings to wire compatible themostats. The Honeywell C7189 wireless indoor remote temperature sensor is not compatible, and we don't like the complicated Mitsubishi MRCH1 wireless remote controller because it's big, ugly, and conflicts with the automation system (Control4) that is supposed to be in control of all the HVAC zones.

This project reinstates the four centrally located wired wall-mounted PAR-21MAA thermostats that were part of the original design, but replaces their temperature-sensing thermistors with resistances generated by "digital potentiometers" controlled by an Arduino microprocessor. The wireless remote temperature sensors send periodic packets over the unlicensed 433 Mhz UHF band to the central receiver. I'm hoping the indoor range will be at least 500 feet, but I don't know yet.

The sensors and central receiver are built and operating, but the system is not yet installed. I'll update this as progress is made.
